#### Adaptive Description Guidelines for Sub-Phases
**CRITICAL**: Generate context-appropriate sub-phase descriptions with AI-driven detail adjustment. For each sub-phase, intelligently assess and adapt the description granularity based on:

**Context-Based Detail Assessment for Sub-Phases**:
- **Sub-phase complexity and scope** - Higher complexity requires more specific guidance
- **Implementation requirements** - Setup-heavy sub-phases need detailed technical components
- **Integration complexity** - Complex integrations require detailed connectivity information
- **Feature focus** - Feature-specific sub-phases may need more guidance than prescriptive details

**Adaptive Description Principles for Sub-Phases**:
1. **Foundation-heavy sub-phases** (setup, architecture, core infrastructure):
   - Include specific technical components, tools, and setup requirements
   - Detail core architectural decisions and technology choices
   - Specify essential configuration and development environment setup
   - Focus on establishing solid technical foundation for the sub-phase

2. **Feature-focused sub-phases** (specific functionality implementation):
   - Provide clear guidance on key outcomes and deliverables
   - Emphasize user experience and functional requirements
   - Include integration points with existing systems
   - Balance specific requirements with implementation flexibility

3. **Integration-heavy sub-phases** (connecting components, data flow, APIs):
   - Detail connectivity requirements and data flow patterns
   - Specify interface definitions and contract considerations
   - Include testing and validation requirements
   - Focus on system cohesion and operational integrity

**Quality Criteria for Sub-Phase Descriptions**:
- **Informative**: Sufficient detail for implementation guidance
- **Actionable**: Clear understanding of expected deliverables
- **Contextual**: Appropriate level of specificity for sub-phase complexity
- **Flexible**: Allow implementation choices while maintaining clear objectives
- **Strategic Alignment**: Descriptions must support parent phase goals and project vision

**Examples of Adaptive Sub-Phase Descriptions**:
- *High-Detail (Foundation Sub-Phase)*: "Establish comprehensive sub-phase architecture with Next.js 14 and TypeScript, configure Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database schema for users/roles/permissions tables, implement JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing, set up API routes structure (/api/auth, /api/users, /api/roles), configure development environment with ESLint/Prettier and testing framework"

- *Guidance-Oriented (Feature Sub-Phase)*: "Build user management functionality with focus on intuitive admin interface, implement comprehensive CRUD operations with proper validation, create role assignment system with granular permissions, ensure responsive design and accessibility standards"

- *Integration-Focused (Integration Sub-Phase)*: "Connect user authentication system with role-based access control, implement seamless data flow between user management and permission systems, create unified API interface for frontend consumption, establish proper error handling and security validation across all integration points"

## Output Format

## Implementation Rules

### Duration Parsing & Conversion
- **String to Minutes**: Parse duration strings and convert to minutes for threshold comparison
  - "30 minutes" → 30 minutes
  - "2 hours" → 120 minutes
  - "1 day" → 480 minutes (8-hour workday)
  - "3 days" → 1440 minutes
  - "1 week" → 2400 minutes (5 workdays)
  - "2 weeks" → 4800 minutes
  - "1 month" → 9600 minutes (4 weeks)
- **Threshold Check**: Only process phases with total duration > 30 minutes

### File Creation Rules
- **Naming Convention**: `{parent_id}.{task_id}.json`
- **Single File**: Only ONE file created per breakdown
- **Complete Content**: All sub-phases contained within the single file
- **Unique IDs**: Ensure no duplicate sub-phase IDs within the breakdown

### Breakdown Patterns
1. **Sequential Dependencies**: Create linear sub-phase chain (10.1 → 10.2 → 10.3)
2. **Parallel Dependencies**: Create parallel sub-phases (10.1, 10.2 can run together)
3. **Complex Dependencies**: Use milestone-based breakdown within sub-phases
4. **Multi-Level Support**: Support sub-phases with their own sub-components within the same file

2. **Phase Selection**: Scan all phases and identify exactly ONE phase with duration > 60 minutes
3. **Duration Parsing**: Convert duration strings to numeric minutes format for accurate threshold comparison
4. **Breakdown Planning**: Apply dependency-based decomposition to selected phase
5. **Single File Creation**: Generate ONE JSON file containing all sub-phases using `{phase_id}` naming
6. **Dependency Validation**: Ensure all dependencies are maintained within the file
7. **Output Generation**: Create single comprehensive file for the breakdown

### File Generation Process
1. **Single File Creation**: Create `.ai/plan/{selected_phase_id}.json` containing all sub-phases
2. **Sub-Phase Planning**: Plan all sub-phases that will be included in the file
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Map dependencies between sub-phases within the file
4. **Content Organization**: Organize all sub-phases, dependencies, and execution plan in single file
5. **Validation**: Ensure file contains complete breakdown information

### Example Execution
- **Input Phase**: ID 2, duration "8-10 weeks" (> 60 minutes ✓)
- **Single File Created**: `2.json` containing:
  - Original phase information (task_id: 2)
  - Sub-phase 2.1: Canvas Infrastructure
  - Sub-phase 2.2: API Node System
  - Sub-phase 2.3: Data Chaining Engine
  - Sub-phase 2.4: Logic Node Implementation
  - Execution plan with dependencies and milestones
  - All within the same file

### Quality Assurance Checklist
